# SF WDI 19/20 - Project One

## DESCRIPTION

I run a indie t-shirt line and it can be difficult finding new artists to collaborate with. You can spend hours browsing dribbble.com or deviantart since those sites attract designers in all sorts of genres. Merch-connect only focuses on featuring art from artists who do merch design for bands and indie clothing lines.

**Technologies applied to this project:**

* Node.js
* Mongoose
* mongoDB
* jQuery / masonry.js / underscore.js
* Internal APIs
* AJAX

You will each need to turn in an individual project, but you will move faster and learn more if you take time to pair program with other students.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

** From your terminal type: **
* Clone this repo git clone https://github.com/RobCardenas/Project-One.git
* cd project-one
* npm install --save
* voila
